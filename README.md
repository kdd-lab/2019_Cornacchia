## Modeling Human Mobility considering Spatial, Temporal and Social Dimensions.


Generative models of human mobility have the purpose of generating realistic trajectories for a set of agents.

RET AND EXP

We propose an extension of GeoSim, a state-of-the-art model which takes into account the social dimension introducing two mechanisms in addition to the explore and preferential return ones: individual preference and social influence. We include incrementally three mobility mechanisms to improve its modeling capability. In the first extension, we include a mechanism that takes into account the spatial distance between locations. Then, we include a spatial mechanism for considering both the relevance of a location together with the spatial distance. In the last extension, we include a Mobility Diary Generator, a data-driven algorithm able to capture the tendency of individuals to follow a circadian rhythm. We also propose several additional features that can be included in the proposed generative algorithm to model human mobility, also considering other aspects such as the popularity of a node or include a constrain in the location an agent can reach in a given time.
